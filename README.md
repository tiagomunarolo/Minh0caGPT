# Minh0caGPT

Minh0caGPT is a generative text project designed to explore and experiment with various deep learning models for text generation. This project leverages **Python**, **PyTorch**, **Keras**, and **TensorFlow** to create and compare two different text generation models: **LSTM** and **GPT**.

## Project Overview

Minh0caGPT aims to generate coherent and contextually relevant text by training two types of models on a given dataset:
1. **LSTM Model** - A sequence-to-sequence model for handling sequential text data.
2. **GPT Model** - A transformer-based model designed for more sophisticated, context-aware text generation.

This project demonstrates how these two models perform on similar text generation tasks, providing a comparison between traditional LSTM and modern GPT-based approaches.
